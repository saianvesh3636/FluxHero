# Project info (auto-detected, edit if needed)
project:
  name: "FluxHero"
  language: "Python, TypeScript"
  framework: "Backend: Numba/FastAPI, Frontend: React/Next.js"
  description: "Adaptive retail quant trading system with JIT-optimized strategies and dual-mode trading (trend-following + mean-reversion)"

# Commands (auto-detected from package.json/pyproject.toml)
commands:
  test: ""
  lint: ""
  build: ""

# Rules - instructions the AI MUST follow
# These are injected into every prompt
rules:
  - "Always use Numba @njit decorator for performance-critical loops involving price calculations"
  - "Use explicit type annotations for Numba compatibility (float64, int32 arrays)"
  - "All indicator calculations must complete in <100ms for 10k candles (benchmark required)"
  - "Implement async operations for API calls and I/O (use httpx, aiohttp, asyncio)"
  - "Follow modular architecture: separate computation/, strategy/, execution/, risk/ folders"
  - "Every feature must include unit tests with edge cases and performance benchmarks"
  - "Backend uses Python 3.10+, Frontend uses TypeScript with strict mode"
  - "No heavy databases: use SQLite for operational data, Parquet for cache"
  - "All trading signals must include explanation logging (why signal fired)"
  - "Risk management is mandatory: 1% max risk per trade, stop-loss on all positions"
  - "Follow next-bar fill logic in backtesting (signal on bar N, fill at bar N+1 open)"
  - "Frontend must have real-time updates via WebSocket, 5-second polling fallback"

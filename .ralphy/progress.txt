  * VectorBT: Good performance but vectorized approach conflicts with event-driven live trading
  * Zipline-reloaded: Too heavyweight, incompatible data pipeline

- AUDIT_TASKS.md: All phases (1-6) complete ✅

[2026-01-22 10:45] Parallel Test Execution - Phase 1 Complete
- Added pytest-xdist>=3.5.0 to requirements.txt
- Created pyproject.toml with pytest configuration including addopts="-n auto"
- Installed pytest-xdist and verified installation
- Verified pytest -n auto uses auto-detected worker count (10 workers)
- Verified pytest -n 0 successfully disables parallel execution
- Verified bare pytest command uses parallel execution by default
- Updated REQUIREMENTS.md to mark Feature 1 and Feature 2 as complete
- All computational tests (87 tests) pass with parallel execution
[2026-01-22 11:42:57] Phase 2 Task 1: Completed running full test suite with pytest -n auto. Documented findings in PARALLEL_TEST_FINDINGS.md. Found ~6-7 test failures and identified test hang issue at 90%+ completion. Pytest-xdist working correctly with 10 parallel workers.
[2026-01-22] Phase 2 Task 2: Fixed tests using shared files for parallel execution compatibility

**Task**: Fix tests using shared files by switching to tmp_path fixture

**Changes Made**:
1. tests/unit/test_parquet_store.py - Replaced tempfile.mkdtemp() with tmp_path fixture (2 occurrences)
2. tests/unit/test_api_server.py - Replaced tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() with tmp_path in test_db fixture
3. tests/unit/test_daily_reboot.py - Replaced 16 occurrences of tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() and 1 NamedTemporaryFile with tmp_path
4. tests/unit/test_logging_config.py - Replaced tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() with tmp_path in all tests
5. tests/unit/test_sqlite_store.py - Replaced tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() with tmp_path (2 occurrences)
6. tests/integration/test_frontend_backend_validation.py - Replaced tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() with tmp_path
7. tests/integration/test_full_integration.py - Replaced tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() with tmp_path

**Benefits**:
- tmp_path is process-safe and works correctly with pytest-xdist parallel execution
- Each test gets its own unique temporary directory per worker
- Automatic cleanup handled by pytest
- Eliminates file conflicts between parallel workers

**Testing**:
- Verified tests pass with parallel execution (-n 4)
- Linting passed (auto-fixed unused imports)
- Fixed tempfile usage in 7 test files, 20+ total test functions

**Files Modified**:
- tests/unit/test_parquet_store.py
- tests/unit/test_api_server.py
- tests/unit/test_daily_reboot.py
- tests/unit/test_logging_config.py
- tests/unit/test_sqlite_store.py
- tests/integration/test_frontend_backend_validation.py
- tests/integration/test_full_integration.py
- TASKS.md (marked Phase 2 Task 2 as complete)

**Status**: ✅ Phase 2 Task 2 Complete - Tests now use tmp_path for parallel safety

## 2026-01-22 - Phase 2 Task 3: Port Binding Analysis

**Task**: Fix tests binding to specific ports by implementing dynamic port allocation

**Analysis Performed**:
- Searched for hardcoded port patterns (port=\d+, localhost:\d+, etc.)
- Searched for socket binding calls (socket.bind, server.bind, etc.)
- Searched for server creation patterns (asyncio.start_server, TCPServer, etc.)

**Findings**:
✅ **NO PORT BINDING ISSUES FOUND**

All WebSocket and API server tests use FastAPI's TestClient:
- tests/unit/test_api_server.py - Uses TestClient (line 69)
- tests/integration/test_websocket_auth.py - Uses TestClient (multiple)
- tests/unit/test_websocket_frontend.py - File content validation only

FastAPI TestClient operates in-process without binding to actual network ports, making it inherently parallel-safe.

**Port references found** (non-binding):
- tests/documentation/test_user_guide.py:187 - String assertion
- tests/unit/test_auth.py:278 - String assertion  
- tests/unit/test_config.py:41-43 - CORS config validation

**Documentation Created**:
- docs/PARALLEL_TEST_PORT_ANALYSIS.md

**Files Updated**:
- TASKS.md (marked Phase 2 Task 3 as complete)

**Status**: ✅ Phase 2 Task 3 Complete - No port conflicts exist, tests are parallel-safe

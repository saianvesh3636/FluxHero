### Requirements Coverage

✅ **R8.1.2**: Retry logic handles all failure types correctly (timeout, 5xx, connection errors)  
✅ **R8.2.2**: WebSocket auto-reconnect handles failures (max 5 retries, exponential backoff)  
✅ **R8.2.4**: Heartbeat monitor detects stale connections (>60s timeout)  
✅ **All Components**: Handle invalid data gracefully (NaN, Inf, empty, malformed)  
✅ **System Resilience**: Recovers from complete failures (API + WS)  
✅ **Edge Cases**: Propagate correctly through calculations  

### Key Error Handling Patterns Validated

1. **API Client**:
   - Retries on 5xx and network errors (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
   - No retry on 4xx client errors (fail fast)
   - Rate limiting enforced (blocks when limit exceeded)
   - Graceful handling of malformed responses

2. **WebSocket Feed**:
   - Auto-reconnect on disconnect (max 5 attempts)
   - Heartbeat monitoring (timeout after 60s of no data)
   - Stale connection detection via `is_stale()`
   - Graceful handling of auth failures

3. **Indicators**:
   - Handle edge cases: NaN, Inf, negative, zero, single point, empty
   - Warmup period produces NaN (expected behavior)
   - Valid values after warmup period
   - No crashes on extreme inputs

4. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Fails fast on initial setup errors
   - Continues after WebSocket reconnection
   - Signal callbacks work correctly

### Validation Status

✅ **35/35 tests passing**  
✅ **Linting clean**  
✅ **All error scenarios covered**  
✅ **System resilience validated**  

### Next Steps

Continue to Phase 17 - Task 7: Performance benchmark (ensure 10k candle indicator calculation completes in <500ms)

[2026-01-21 20:41:27] Phase 17 - Task 7: Performance Benchmark Complete
- Updated tests/performance/test_benchmark.py with correct function signatures
- Fixed imports to use fluxhero.backend.* paths
- Added JIT warmup in fixture to ensure fair performance measurements
- All indicators complete in well under 500ms target:
  * EMA: 0.06ms (8333x faster than target)
  * RSI: 0.10ms
  * ATR: 0.08ms
  * KAMA: 0.14ms
  * ADX: 0.20ms
  * Volatility State: 0.08ms
  * Regime Detection: 4.99ms
  * Composite (all indicators): 6.17ms
- All 11 performance tests passing
- Linting passed with ruff

Task: Create user guide for running the system (setup, configuration, monitoring)
Phase: 18 - Documentation & Deployment

Completed:
1. Created comprehensive USER_GUIDE.md in docs/ directory
   - 10 major sections covering all aspects of system usage
   - Detailed installation instructions for backend and frontend
   - Complete configuration guide with .env template
   - Step-by-step instructions for running the system
   - Dashboard usage guide for all 4 tabs (Live Trading, Analytics, Trade History, Backtesting)
   - Comprehensive monitoring section with log analysis
   - Common operations (daily startup, running backtests, exporting data, archiving)
   - Extensive troubleshooting guide with 6 common issues and solutions
   - Best practices for risk management, strategy optimization, system maintenance
   - Quick reference section with common commands and environment variables

2. Created test suite for documentation validation
   - 28 comprehensive tests in tests/documentation/test_user_guide.py
   - Tests cover existence, structure, completeness, and quality
   - Validates that referenced files exist
   - Checks for security warnings and configuration guidance
   - Ensures troubleshooting and best practices sections are comprehensive
   - All tests passing (28/28)

3. Fixed linting issues
   - Removed unused import (os module)
   - Code passes ruff linting

4. Updated FLUXHERO_TASKS.md
   - Marked "Write API documentation" as complete (was already done)
   - Marked "Create user guide" as complete

Files Created:
- docs/USER_GUIDE.md (35,000+ characters, comprehensive guide)
- tests/documentation/test_user_guide.py (300+ lines, 28 tests)
- tests/documentation/__init__.py

Status: Task complete. User guide provides comprehensive documentation for setup, configuration, running, monitoring, and troubleshooting the FluxHero system.

Next Task: Document risk management rules and circuit breaker behavior (Phase 18, Task 3)

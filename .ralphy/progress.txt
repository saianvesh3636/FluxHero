### Files created:
- fluxhero/backend/core/__init__.py
- fluxhero/backend/core/logging_config.py
- tests/unit/test_logging_config.py

### Next steps:
The logging configuration module is ready for use. Next tasks in Phase 2:
- Add structured logging to parquet_store.py
- Add structured logging to sqlite_store.py
- Replace print() statements in api/server.py
- Verify consistency with order_manager.py logging pattern

[2026-01-22 - Phase 2: Structured Logging - Task 2]
Task: Add structured logging to backend/storage/parquet_store.py

Changes:
- Added structured logging to all read/write operations in parquet_store.py
  - save_candles(): debug log on start, info log on success, error log on failure
  - load_candles(): debug log on start and for non-existent files, info log on success, error log on failure
  - is_cache_fresh(): debug logs for cache state checks
  - delete_cache(): info log on successful deletion, debug for non-existent files, error on failure
  - clear_all_cache(): info logs for start and completion with counts
- All logging includes structured context (symbol, timeframe, num_candles, cache_path, etc.)
- Added 11 new tests for logging functionality in test_parquet_store.py
- All tests pass (42/42)
- Linting passes with auto-fix applied for f-string issues

Status: COMPLETE
Next task: Add structured logging to backend/storage/sqlite_store.py
[2026-01-22 - Phase 2: Structured Logging - Task 3]
Task: Add structured logging to backend/storage/sqlite_store.py

Changes:
- Added structured logging to all database operations in sqlite_store.py
  - initialize(): info log with db_path on start
  - _insert_trade_sync(): debug log on insert, info log on success with trade_id
  - _update_trade_sync(): debug log on update, info log on success with fields_updated
  - get_trade(): debug logs for fetch attempt and result (found/not found)
  - get_open_trades(): debug logs with count
  - get_recent_trades(): debug logs with limit and count
  - get_trades_by_date_range(): debug logs with date range and count
  - _upsert_position_sync(): debug log on upsert, info log on success
  - _delete_position_sync(): debug/info logs for deletion
  - get_position(): debug logs with result status
  - get_open_positions(): debug logs with count
  - _set_setting_sync(): debug log on set, info log on success
  - get_setting(): debug logs for fetch with default handling
  - get_all_settings(): debug logs with count
  - archive_old_trades(): improved error logging with structured context
  - get_database_size(): debug log with size
  - close(): info logs for database closure
  - _write_worker(): improved sqlite3.Error logging with error_type
- All logging includes structured context (symbol, trade_id, shares, key, count, db_path, etc.)
- Added 6 new tests for logging functionality in test_sqlite_store.py
- All tests pass (46/46)
- Linting passes with no issues

Status: COMPLETE
Next task: Replace all print() statements in backend/api/server.py with proper logging calls


[2026-01-22T00:23] Phase 2 - Task 4: Replace print() statements with logging in server.py
- Replaced all 16 print() statements in fluxhero/backend/api/server.py with proper logging calls
- Added logging import and configured logger using logging.getLogger(__name__) pattern
- Updated startup/shutdown messages to use logger.info() with structured context
- Updated WebSocket connection/disconnection messages with structured logging
- Changed error messages to use logger.error() with exc_info=True for better debugging
- Added comprehensive tests for logging functionality:
  * test_no_print_statements_in_server: Validates no print statements remain
  * test_logger_exists: Verifies logger configuration
  * test_server_startup_logging: Tests startup and shutdown logging
  * test_websocket_connection_logging: Tests WebSocket logging
  * test_websocket_error_logging: Validates error logging setup
- All tests passing (3/3 new logging tests + basic sanity checks)
- Linting passed (ruff check) for both server.py and test_api_server.py
- Logging pattern consistent with order_manager.py and other storage modules
- Updated AUDIT_TASKS.md to mark Phase 2 tasks 4 and 5 as complete
